# ch_launcher – Step 4 Implementation Summary

> This document must be updated after each Stage 3 task is implemented. Keep it in the repo (do not delete) and ensure every stage notes its verification result before proceeding to the next one.

## Preconditions
- Feature branch created (`feature/ch-launcher` or similar) before any code changes.
- Steps 2 and 3 approved.
- Planning docs committed prior to implementation.

## Stage Tracking
| Stage | Description | Status | Notes / Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `ch.py` skeleton & utilities | _pending_ |  |
| 2 | `setup` command (env + deps) | _pending_ |  |
| 3 | Runtime commands & dependency checks | _pending_ |  |
| 4 | Wrapper updates (`ch`, `ch.bat`, optional `ch.ps1`) | _pending_ |  |
| 5 | Docs, help text, smoke tests | _pending_ |  |

## Verification Log
- (Add dated entries here as each stage passes its manual smoke tests; include commands run such as `./ch runserver --no-reload` and browser checks at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.)

## Outstanding Issues / Risks
- (Document any blockers, follow-ups, or TODOs discovered during implementation.)
