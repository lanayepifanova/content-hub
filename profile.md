#### Built and sold a property management tool in 4 months #####
Part 3: What problem are you solving? Why property management?
im 20 y/o, i learned how to code 4 months ago, and i just sold my first software startup, which was a property management platform. 
why did i do this? to be honest, i just picked the simplest problem to work on
i knew some people who owned apartments in nyc, and started getting lunch with them, just picking their brains on how it worked, and asked them to just complain to me
so for like one or two hours, i would sit and take notes about how they tracked all the rent payments, how they handled maintenance requests, how they did their bookkeeping and accounting, what they did if they had vacancies, and how they sorted thru phone calls and text messages
and i think theres a lot of value in meeting people in person and like really getting to know the customers that u are serving
i gathered A LOT of pain points. i think a lot of us, like the younger generation, college students, etc, we try to tackle really big problems, trying to sell to massive corporations and very efficient global firms, and miss the fact that there is a huge need and market demand from the older generation, and small + medium sized businesses
the catch here, is that obviously, you can’t charge as much for your software. but i will argue, that its an awesome place to start, and a much easier niche to dominate, and you can always scale up as your technology gets better

Part 4: Who exactly is your customer? What’s their biggest pain point?
im 20 y/o, i learned how to code 4 months ago, and i just sold my first software startup, a property management platform
for anyone thinking of starting something similar, please do. here are all the pain points ive gathered. these are all problems i heard first hand, and feel free to just COPY ME
so here is the exact niche i served.
landlords that owned somewhere from 2-20 small to medium apartment buildings with 6-50 units each, usually around the age of like 38 to literally 75 years old
their team usually consists of like 1-3 office assistants, a couple of superintendents or maintenance guys, and sometimes a separate accountant or bookkeeper
their workflow goes like this
paper ledgers, excel, physical checks, phone calls, clipboards, physical mail. 
RARELY ANYONE USES MODERN SAAS TOOLS
When it comes to Rent Collection, they have to chase down tenants manually, and there are SO MANY missed payments, lost checks, and uncertainty around cash flow. There are no automatic records or analytics. 
Late payments are tracked in a spreadsheet or physical notebook. Sometimes tenants text or call to say “I mailed it” and the landlord just takes their word for it. 
The landlord or office assistant deposits checks manually at a bank every month

Part 5: What’s their workflow right now? How are they solving this problem today?
im 20 y/o, i learned how to code 4 months ago, and i just sold my first software startup, a property management platform
for anyone thinking of starting something similar, just copy me
rent collection was honestly the most important issue, which makes sense since thats where the money comes in
but they also complained about leasing and vacancies, which also affects the bottom line pretty heavily. currently the leases are like a Word document thats printed and signed in person, and they check references by calling previous landlords (if they check). there are NO digital records, its a super slow process, and its hard to track rent roll or upcoming expirations. i was literally so surprised by the operations guys like everyones on paper
and for communication, like information is scattered across a million texts and calls. nothing is centralized, supers call for updates, tenants called directly, and there are a bunch of unopened threads everywhere
no paper trail of maintenance history, tenants call, text, or leave voicemails, theres no tracking system, although most people have like a physical notebook for repairs, so things fall through the cracks all the time
for bookkeeping and accounting, Excel or QuickBooks Desktop, they input data manually like once a week, and expenses are stored in folders, like receipts and invoices in like physical boxes. It was crazy. There are missing receipts.

Part 6: How big is this market? Could this expand beyond NYC? Who else is solving this problem? Why hasn’t this market been fully captured yet? How big is spending power? What are existing solutions, current players, what do they do well/poorly?
im 20 y/o, i learned how to code 4 months ago, and i just sold my first software startup, a property management platform
sometime in june and july, i got on some calls with like potential investors and some early stage VC firms
they all asked one question
What does the competition look like? Whats the total addressable market? Why hasn’t this market been fully captured yet?
My answer is that most of the big tools like AppFolio, Buildium, and RentRedi focus on institutional property managers and not independent owners. 
There are thousands of small to mid landlords in NYC and hundreds of thousands nationwide managing millions of units manually. We just dont hear about these people. They aren’t famous. They aren’t managed by a big property management group. 
The main thing is that I focused a lot on the NYC area because that was what I was comfortable with.

Part 7: Whats the product? What are the features?
im 20 y/o, i learned how to code 4 months ago, and i just sold my first software startup
It was a lightweight property management platform I built specifically for small, independent NYC landlords — people who owned anywhere from a few brownstones to 40–50 units, but weren’t using modern tools. Most of them were managing everything in spreadsheets, text messages, and paper folders. The product was basically a central dashboard where they could:
Track rent payments and lease dates Log maintenance issues and assign them to handymen Store tenant info and documents in one place Automatically send reminders for upcoming rent or expiring leases It wasn’t anything crazy technically — just simple, fast, and easy to use. The core was organization and clarity for people who were managing 20–50 units but didn’t have the systems of big property firms.
When I first launched the MVP, it had about five main features: 
Rent Tracking Dashboard — Each tenant had a small profile showing rent status (“Paid,” “Pending,” or “Late”). You could mark payments manually or upload a CSV. 
Ticket System — Tenants could text or submit small issue forms that automatically showed up in the landlord’s dashboard. The landlord could assign the ticket to a handyman. 
Document Storage — A small file upload section for leases, insurance forms, or receipts. 
Tenant Messaging — Basic SMS integration for updates or reminders (“Your rent is due tomorrow.”) 
Unit Overview — A spreadsheet-style list of all units, who lives where, and the last payment date. The goal wasn’t to be everything at once — it was just to replace the messy spreadsheets and text chains.

Part 8:  How did you design it? Why is your solution 10x better than what they use now? 
Design & UX I designed it in Figma before building it. The UI was intentionally simple — white background, minimal color, large readable text. Most of these landlords were in their 40s–60s, so I avoided clutter and technical jargon. It felt more like an upgraded Google Sheet than a SaaS product. 
Each section of the dashboard looked like a card: “Properties” “Tenants” “Maintenance” “Payments” Each card linked to a clean table with editable fields. 
I spent a lot of time doing manual onboarding, sitting next to landlords and watching them click through the app. That’s how I caught small things — like needing bigger buttons or changing “Add New Unit” to “Add Apartment.” 
🚀 Why It Was 10x Better Than What They Had For most small landlords, their “system” was: A spreadsheet for rent tracking A Dropbox folder for leases A dozen text threads with tenants And sticky notes everywhere That’s four different systems. 
My platform combined all of that into one simple dashboard that actually matched how they already thought about their buildings. It wasn’t “10x better” because of fancy AI or automation — it was better because it was 1 click instead of 12, and it looked clean, not intimidating. 
They didn’t need to hire a property manager or pay for big enterprise software like AppFolio or Buildium (which are designed for 200+ unit portfolios). The platform felt personal, lightweight, and made for them — not like they were being forced to use something corporate.

Part 9: What was the business model + pricing like? How did you make money?
im 20 y/o, i learned how to code 4 months ago, and i just sold my first software startup, a property management platform
It was a simple B2B SaaS model — landlords paid a monthly subscription per unit. I priced it at $2 per unit per month, with a minimum of $25/month. 
So a landlord with 30 units would pay $60/month. That sounds small, but these landlords were very price-sensitive. 
Most weren’t using any software at all — they saw tools like Buildium or AppFolio charging $80–$200/month and thought it was overkill.It was a simple B2B SaaS model — landlords paid a monthly subscription per unit.

Most weren’t using any software at all — they saw tools like Buildium or AppFolio charging $80–$200/month and thought it was overkill.
My pitch was: “You don’t need to be a professional property company to stay organized. Just pay less than a dinner out per month and run everything from one place.” Over time, I experimented with an annual plan ($600/year for up to 50 units), and that’s what I offered during onboarding — I’d just take Venmo or a check to make it easy.

Part 10:  What was the pricing model? What was the LTV and CAC? What's the payback period on customer acquisition? Is there a clear path to profitability?
Since I only had 7 landlords managing between 20–50 units, the total user base was around 250–300 units. 
At ~$2/unit/month, that’s around $500–600/month recurring revenue (MRR) at the peak before the sale. 
That’s ~$6k–7k annual run rate (ARR) — nothing massive, but enough to show real traction for a solo founder who just learned to code. 
Because I did all sales and onboarding manually, there were no paid ads. My Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) was basically $0 — just time and effort.
If CAC was close to zero and the minimum plan was $25/month, payback was instant — first month covered it. Even if you value my time as a “cost,” it took roughly 2–3 hours to onboard each landlord manually. So if you assign an hourly rate of $25, the payback period was about 1.5 months.
The type of user I targeted (small landlords) tends to stick with tools once they’re set up — it’s too painful to switch. My churn was low because I onboarded people personally, helped import their tenant data, and customized small things for them. So average retention looked like 12–18 months minimum. At $25–$60/month, LTV was around $300–$700 per landlord.

Part 11: How did you find PMF? How did you get your first few users? How did you get paying customers? What’s your biggest challenge with adoption?
im 20 y/o, i learned how to code 4 months ago, and i just sold my first software startup, a property management platform
I found PMF through conversations, not data. I talked to around 25 small landlords across NYC — owners of 3–5 buildings who didn’t use modern tools. They all described the same pain:
They hated existing software like AppFolio, Buildium, or TenantCloud — too expensive, too many buttons, too corporate. That’s when it clicked: there’s this underserved segment between “spreadsheets” and “enterprise software.”
My first conversation was an intro from an old boss of mine at my real estate internship. One of her friends owned a small real estate management firm with a property management segment. 
I got intros through word-of-mouth — a couple landlords referred me to their friends because they “didn’t want to keep explaining rent tracking manually.”
I kept everything manual and personal — I’d onboard them myself, import their spreadsheets, and sit down (sometimes literally in their office) to show how the dashboard worked.
For the first month, I made it free. Then I sent a text that said: “Hey, I’m moving the platform to a paid plan next week — $25/month or $60 if you have more units. Want to stay on?”
My biggest challenge was that landlords are creatures of habit. Even when your product is clearly better, they’ll say: “I’ve been using this spreadsheet for 15 years, it works fine.” So adoption wasn’t just about software — it was behavioral change. I realized the real work wasn’t coding, it was education and trust-building.

Part 12: What was the timeline for everything? 
im 20 y/o, i learned how to code 4 months ago, and i just sold my first software startup, a property management platform
Month 0 — Idea Phase (Late Spring) The idea came from conversations with small NYC landlords — mostly older people I knew through friends and family who were constantly complaining about how annoying rent collection and maintenance tracking were. I started asking questions and realized how manual their workflow was: Spreadsheets for rent Texts for maintenance Dropbox for leases No integrations, no dashboards — just chaos. At that point, I had only been learning to code for about a month, but the problem felt so tangible and local that I decided to just build something small to organize it all.
Month 1–2 — Building the MVP I locked in and coded the MVP myself over about 6–8 weeks. Stack was React + Firebase (so I could move fast without worrying about backend complexity). I didn’t build everything at once — I focused on one flow: “Landlord logs in → Adds tenants → Marks rent as paid or unpaid.” Then I added basic maintenance tracking and document uploads. Design was done in Figma — simple, clean, minimal color. I wasn’t trying to impress anyone; I just wanted it to be functional and clear for older landlords who weren’t tech-savvy. By the end of Month 2, I had a working web app that did the basics.
Month 3–4 — User Onboarding & Feedback I spent the next two months manually onboarding my first few users — literally visiting them, importing their spreadsheets, and helping them set it up. I didn’t try to “scale.” I just wanted to see if anyone would actually use it consistently. That phase was where I got real feedback: “Add SMS reminders.” “Make it easier to add properties.” “Can you make it work on my phone?” Every week I’d ship small updates based on feedback. By the end of Month 4, I had 7 landlords using it actively — paying small monthly subscriptions, and giving me recurring feedback. That was enough to prove there was value.

Part 13: How long did it take to build? What was your tech stack like? How did you learn to code so quickly? What was the hardest part of building the MVP?
I coded the MVP in about 2 months, full-time, while still learning as I went. The first 3 weeks were mostly me reading documentation and watching crash courses on YouTube.
React + Tailwind + Node/Express + PostgreSQL + Supabase + Stripe + Firebase is a standard indie-hacker stack. 
Not too enterprise-level (no Kubernetes or GraphQL nonsense).
Not too beginner-level (shows you can deploy real software). 
Hosting choices (Vercel + Render) are realistic for solo devs.
The Stack 
Frontend: 
React (for the landlord dashboard and tenant portal) 
Tailwind CSS (for fast UI iteration) 
Used Zustand for lightweight state management — Redux felt like overkill
Integrated Chart.js for quick rent collection visualizations 
Backend: 
Node.js + Express REST API 
PostgreSQL on Supabase (hosted DB with easy auth + storage) 
Added CRON jobs via Render Scheduler to send automated rent reminders daily at 10 AM 
Used Prisma ORM for schema management 
Hosting: 
Vercel for the frontend (instant deployments + custom domain) 
Render for backend (cheap, simple scaling) 
Cloudflare for DNS + caching 
Payments: 
Stripe Connect (so landlords could receive rent directly to their bank accounts) 
Integrated webhooks for payment confirmation → updated rent ledger automatically 
Notifications: 
Twilio for SMS reminders (“Rent due tomorrow!”) 
SendGrid for email invoices and receipts 
Auth:
Firebase Authentication (email/password + Google login)

Part 13: How did the acquisition happen? Why did you sell? Why didn’t you let it take traction?
im 20 y/o, i learned how to code 4 months ago, and i just sold my first software startup, a property management platform
After about 4 months, one of my early customers — a private landlord with ~50 units across three Brooklyn buildings — messaged me saying: “Could I just buy Unitbot outright? I don’t want to depend on a third-party platform. I want to own it.” 
At first, I thought they meant a long-term license, but they genuinely wanted to buy the software, domain, and database.
I realized my personal ceiling. Around Month 4, I hit a point where I knew that scaling it would mean going deeper into property tech — compliance, payments, tenant portals, etc. I wasn’t passionate about property management long-term. When one of my early users (who owned ~40 units) offered to buy the whole thing outright to use internally, it was a clean exit that let me move on to my next project.
The product was intentionally narrow. I didn’t build 100 features — I built one solid workflow. The simplicity actually made it work better. I didn’t need complex integrations or dashboards — just a functional way to track tenants, payments, and maintenance.
The goal was: “Can I build something real, useful, and revenue-generating this summer while learning how to build things? I wanted to learn tbh, and I know now that I want to dive deeper into startups and do more of the traditional things. 
I want a cofounder. I want to do pitch competitions

Part 15: What was the deal structure for a Micro SaaS acquisition?
im 20 y/o, i learned how to code 4 months ago, and i just sold my first software startup, a property management platform
this is the part where all the finance bros are interested. so here are all the facts
heres my traction:
i had 7 landlords managing 20-50 units each
Total user base was 250-300 units
At $2/unit/month, its around $500-$600/month MRR at the peak before the sale
Its $6k-$7k ARR 
typical multiples for these deals are 1.5x-3x annual profit for tiny indie apps, or 0.8x-2x ARR if they are very early stage or pre scale
So in typical multiples, it would be around a $5k-$10k value
However, I sold to a strategic buyer, one of my actual customers
Strategic buyers pay more because they save the cost of hiring a dev or agency which is around $10-$20k
I provided full code ownership, and worked out of the box of their specific business, and replaced their manual systems. 
Its a fully built, private, branded software tool for managing 50 units, and would’ve cost $40k for an agency to build. 
Since it was like my first project $25k makes sense.
They offered $25K to own the code outright — about what it would’ve cost to rebuild the same functionality with a dev agency

Part 16: The Legal Details
LLC, asset sale, IP transfer, lawyer for $2K — all textbook micro-acquisition behavior. Solo founders rarely do stock transfers or NDAs; “bill of sale + IP assignment” is exactly how these transactions happen.
Used a lawyer recommended through a local NYC tech group i was close to
We met at a café in the East Village to finalize everything — I transferred the GitHub repo, domain, and database dump once the wire cleared.”
What I transferred: GitHub repo (private repo → new owner) Stripe account credentials (changed ownership under their LLC) Supabase/PostgreSQL database dump Domain (via Google Domains transfer) SendGrid/Twilio API keys All documentation + admin credentials I owned the project under my LLC, so the lawyer advised structuring it as an asset sale — not a stock sale — to keep things simple and avoid unnecessary filings.
We used: A bill of sale (to transfer ownership of digital assets) An IP assignment agreement (to legally assign all rights to code, name, and brand) I included: 1 month of post-sale support (bug fixes + training) Ongoing friendship — I still check in on them occasionally. “There was no champagne moment — just two people shaking hands over coffee, transferring a GitHub repo, and walking away knowing something real was built.”

Part 17: Offboarding the Client
After the acquisition, I spent about a month helping the buyer’s property managers get comfortable using Unitbot.
I created a 2-hour Zoom onboarding session where I walked their staff through the landlord dashboard, tenant profiles, and rent-tracking system. 
I wrote a 15-page onboarding guide in Notion explaining how to add new tenants, generate payment links, and set up Twilio SMS reminders.
I migrated their old Excel data into the PostgreSQL database manually using a small Python script (pandas → SQL import). I stayed on-call for the first few weeks to fix any weird edge cases (duplicate tenants, mismatched rent due dates, etc).

Part 18: What would I do differently next time?
There are a lot of things I did right. I understood my target user really well, I did really good with analyzing the problem, understanding the market, validating the idea, and launching a simple MVP, and im proud of the fact that a beginner project, like the first project ive ever done was able to be monetized. i learned about rapid development, internal testing, having private beta users, and tech stacks, and prioritizing features
Next time, I will probably go further to launch on distribution platforms, do some content and share progress and updates, do partnerships and really scale to more users. 
The biggest thing is that to scale, you need a team. Like when I try again, I will find a cofounder, and also when it comes time, like build a team for engineering, design and growth, and like move from a scrappy infrastructure setup to a more robust backend and monitoring, invest in marketing channels like paid ads, SEO, partnership, and integrations. 
When it comes to my next project, I’m also going to seek more help from venture capital, accelerators, and probably try to raise some funding so I can hire people. 
It was an awesome project to learn from and I’m happy I made money along the way. 

Part 19: Where am I spending my money?
So to be honest, 20k is not a lot of money so I haven’t really touched it right now
I’ll probably use half of it for travel. I didn’t really get to travel a lot as a kid, since my family was pretty poor, so i want to use about half just to travel and take some trips to see different cultures and see the world
The other half I probably won’t touch. Its always good to have like 10k in cash just as a safety net if I ever want to move somewhere, take a gap again and not worry about rent for a couple months, or need to pay for a laptop, or put some of that money into my next project
This isn’t life changing money. I think the real value of this experience was teaching me what was possible. Most of the benefits have been mental. 
It gave me the courage to start posting online, attending startup events, living at a hacker house, and trying new projects. I’m using this experience to level up technically. I want to be the best version I can be. Competent but humble, and hardworking but also fun. I like to prioritize people, experiences, and skillsets in my life.
